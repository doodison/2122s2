    "* Delivering the warm-up excercises on time is critical, as it helps also prepare for the tutorial session. *info on handing-in*\n",
    "* As these excercises are meant to help you participate in the tutorial and us to make sure you can get as much as possible from the tutorials, we do not expect perfect answers. However, this is important to show the effort you have put in the excercises and what obstacles you faced."
